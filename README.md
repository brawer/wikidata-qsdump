# Experiment: New Format for Wikidata Dumps?

This is an experiment for a simpler, smaller and much faster (to decompress)
data format for [Wikidata dumps](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download).

| Format      |     Size¹ | Tool   |   Decompression time² |
|-------------|-----------|--------|-----------------------|
| `.json.bz2` |  75.9 GiB | pbzip2 |    5 hours 26 minutes |
| `.json.bz2` |  75.9 GiB | lbzip2 |            59 minutes |
| `.qs.zst`   |  26.6 GiB | zstd   |             6 minutes |


The proposed new format,
[QuickStatements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements)
with [Zstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd) compression,
takes about a third of the current best file size. On a typical modern
cloud server, decompression is about 10 times faster compared to lbzip2,
an exotic tool for the bzip2 format.
(Compared to the more commonly used pbzip2 tool, the speed-up is 150 times;
despite being designed for multi-core machines, pbzip2 appears to use
just a single core, possibly due to a structural quirk of Wikidata dumps).
The speed-up can largely be explained with a compression algorithm
that has been designed for fast decompression on today’s hardware.


## Motivation

As of May 2023, the most compact format for [Wikidata
dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/20230424/) is
JSON with bzip2 compression.  However, the current JSON syntax is very
verbose, which makes it slow to process. Another issue is bzip2: since
its invention 27 years ago, newer algorithms have been designed that
can be decompressed much faster on today’s machines.

As a frequent user of Wikidata dumps, I got annoyed by the high cost of
processing the current format, and I wondered how much could be gained
from a better format. Specifically, a new format should be significantly
smaller in size; much faster to decompress; and easy to understand.

Wikidata editors frequently use the [QuickStatements
tool](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements) for bulk
maintenance. The tool accepts statements in a text syntax that is easy
to understand and quite compact. I wondered if Wikidata dumps could be
encoded as QuickStatements, and compressed with a modern algorithm
such as [Zstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd).


## Extensions to QuickStatements syntax

Note that the current QuickStatements syntax cannot express all of
Wikidata; the major missing piece is ranking. For this experiment, I
encocded preferred and deprecated rank with ↑ and ↓ arrows, as in
`Q12|P9|↑"foo"`. All other missing parts are minor and rare, such as
coordinates on Venus and Mars; for this experiment, I pretended these
were on Earth. To fully encode all of Wikidata as QuickStatements,
suitable syntax would need to be defined and properly documented.
Obviously, it would then also make sense to support this new syntax
in the live QuickStatments tool.

Currently, QuickStatements does not seem to define an escape mechanism
for quote characters. In my experiment, I used an Unicode escape sequence
when a quoted string contained a quote, as in `"foo \u0022 bar"`.

A nice property of the current JSON format is that each item is encoded
on a separate line. It might be nice to preserve this property. This would
need (small, backwards-compatible) extensions to the QuickStatement syntax:
(a) allow multiple labels, aliases
and sitelinks, as in `Q2|Len|"Earth"|Aen|"Planet Earth"|Lfr|"Terre"`;
(b) allow multiple claims (not just multiple qualifiers) on the same
line, perhaps with a `!P` construct similar to the existing `!S`.
This would also make the format slightly more compact.

## Other issues with Wikidata dumps

In a new version of Wikidata dumps, I think it would be good to
address some other things.

1. Wikidata dumps should be atomic snapshots, taken at a defined point
in time. Currently, each item is getting dumped at a slightly different
time. This fuzziness makes it difficult to build reliable systems.
Generating consistent snapshots should be possible since Wikidata’s
production database contains the edit history; the generator could simply
ignore any changes to the live database that are more recent than
the snapshot time.

2. It would be nice if the dump could also include redirects, and indicate
which items have been deleted. For consistency, this should be snapshotted
at the same point in time as the actual data.

3. Statements should be sorted by subject entity ID. This would
allow data consumers to build their own data structures (eg. an LMDB
B-tree or similar) without having to re-shuffle all of Wikidata.

For this experiment, I have not bothered with any of this since it does
not affect the format. (Actually, sorting as in #3 might slightly
change the file size, perhaps making it smaller by a small amount;
but the difference is unlikely to be significant). I’m just noting this
as a wishlist for re-implementing Wikidata dumps.
